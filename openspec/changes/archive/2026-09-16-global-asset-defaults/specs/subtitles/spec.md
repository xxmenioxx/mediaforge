## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Canonical converted subtitle formats
The system SHALL resolve a converted subtitle request through the canonical
pipeline and produce SRT, ASS, or both according to the requested format. A
logical `both` request SHALL be one subtitle transform that performs text
normalization or bitmap OCR once, then renders both artifacts from the same
normalized cue result. SRT SHALL be the default when no converted format is
specified. This change SHALL introduce no new OCR semantics, sidecar
discovery or matching behavior, or parallel subtitle pipeline.

#### Scenario: Converted SRT
- **WHEN** a text or OCR-capable bitmap subtitle is requested as converted SRT
- **THEN** the canonical pipeline produces a `.srt` artifact with normalized cues

#### Scenario: Converted ASS
- **WHEN** a text or OCR-capable bitmap subtitle is requested as converted ASS
- **THEN** the canonical pipeline produces a `.ass` artifact with the converted cues

#### Scenario: Default format
- **WHEN** a converted subtitle request omits an output format
- **THEN** the pipeline selects SRT and preserves existing SRT behavior

#### Scenario: Both converted formats share one cue result
- **WHEN** a text or OCR-capable bitmap subtitle is requested as one logical converted `both` operation
- **THEN** the canonical pipeline performs text normalization or bitmap OCR once and produces both `.srt` and `.ass` artifacts from the same normalized cues
